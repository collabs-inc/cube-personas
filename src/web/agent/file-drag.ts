 * Whether a drag carries OS files. The affordance promises what dropping
 * will do, so it must not appear for a drag that carries no files: a text
 * selection dragged across the window would otherwise light up every
 * terminal it crossed while offering an upload that cannot happen.
 *
 * A nav-internal TreeView drag sets only `text/plain` (useDragDrop.ts) and
 * so shows no affordance either. It still drops and still opens — the
 * gesture works, it just does not advertise itself. The sidebar's file
 * tree is a drop TARGET as of the external-file drop mode
 * (`packages/components/src/TreeView/external-drop.ts`); the affordance for
 * an OS drag there is the tree's own — hint via `dropHintText("sidebar")`,
 * highlight via `useDragDrop`'s `externalTargetFolder`.
